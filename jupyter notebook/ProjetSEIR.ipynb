    "# Introduction to SEIR Simulation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEIR model is a widely-used epidemiological model designed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases within a population. It is based on compartmentalization, dividing the population into four distinct compartments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Susceptible (S)**: Individuals who are susceptible to the disease and can become infected if they come into contact with infectious individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exposed (E)**: Individuals who have been exposed to the disease but are not yet infectious. This represents the latent period during which the individual is infected but not yet showing symptoms or infectious.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Infectious (I)**: Individuals who are infected and can spread the disease to susceptible individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recovered (R)**: Individuals who have recovered from the disease and are assumed to have acquired immunity, at least temporarily. They are not susceptible to reinfection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEIR model tracks the flow of individuals between these compartments over time through a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It considers parameters such as the transmission rate, the incubation period, and the recovery rate to model the dynamics of disease spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "SEIR models are widely used in epidemiology and public health research to study the dynamics of infectious diseases such as influenza, measles, and COVID-19. By adjusting parameters and initial conditions, SEIR simulations can provide insights into the potential trajectory of an epidemic and inform public health interventions.\n"
